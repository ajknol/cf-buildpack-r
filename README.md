# Cloud Foundry R Buildpack

Forked from [Heroku R buildpack](https://github.com/virtualstaticvoid/heroku-buildpack-r) to support Cloud Foundry. Works with R 3.3.1. Tested with Shiny. 

9/6/2016: By default the buildpack uses [http://cloud.r-project.org/](http://cloud.r-project.org/) to download R packages. You can override that by defining an environment variable $CRAN_MIRROR in your `manifest.yml` to point to your CRAN mirror of choice (such as your local CRAN mirror). See `test/shiny` for an example.

## Caveat
JDK / rJava is not supported. Cloud Foundry prefers JRE over JDK.
